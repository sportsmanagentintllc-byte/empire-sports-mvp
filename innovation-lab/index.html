    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      Through personal observation and lived experience, I have become increasingly aware of how fragmented sports development systems can be, particularly in emerging contexts. While individual success stories exist, systemic structures that support transparency, continuity, and equitable access remain limited.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      My academic background in information technology, combined with long-standing engagement with sports education and scouting, has led me to question how digital platforms and organizational design might contribute to more coherent and inclusive sports pathways.
    </p>

    <h2>The Experiment</h2>
    <p>
      This project is an early-stage exploration of how a lightweight digital ecosystem could support talent discovery, education, and coordination among athletes, scouts, and institutions. It is intentionally kept at a prototype level and serves as a practical learning tool rather than a finished venture.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Do Not Know Yet</h2>
    <p>
      At this stage, many questions remain unresolved, particularly around sustainable business models, governance structures, ethical considerations, and long-term scalability. These gaps represent areas where structured academic training and interdisciplinary perspectives are essential.
    </p>

    <h2>Why a Master’s in Innovation & Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>
      I see this project as a living laboratory through which I can apply, test, and critically examine innovation frameworks, entrepreneurial theory, and systems thinking. A Master’s program focused on innovation and entrepreneurship—particularly within a Scandinavian academic context—offers the environment needed to rigorously refine both my thinking and this experiment.

      This page is intentionally minimal and reflective in nature. It documents an ongoing learning process rather than a completed outcome.
